        <h1 style="color: orange;">Introduction To CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.</p><br>

        What Is CSS? <br>
    </h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets <br>
       CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media <br>
       CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once <br>
       External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

    <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p><br>

    <h1 style="color: crimson;">CSS Solved Big Problem</h1>
    <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p><br>
    <p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p><br>
    <p><h1>This is a heading</h1></p><br>
    <h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><br>
     </h3>
    <p>When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
        
        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p><br>
